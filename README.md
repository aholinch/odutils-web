# Web Server
The web server used here is [JLHTTP](https://www.freeutils.net/source/jlhttp/) - the Java Lightweight HTTP Server.  It is very very lightweight.

If you want more features in a Web Server, you can reimplement the handlers in a Servlet for a webapp to be deployed in Tomcat.  Otherwise, you can add a proxy supporting HTTPS and authentication with NGINX or Apache.
